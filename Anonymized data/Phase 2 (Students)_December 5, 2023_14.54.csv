I think the real research may be this final description, and my rating of how confident I was.

Well motorcycle is motorized and so is a car, whereas tricycle, skateboard, bicycle, and finally unicycle are not motorized. 

I searched for similarities in all of the problems. 
Something key is that I visualized all of the words in my mind and compared them all at once visually, and then searched for words to describe differences (kind of tearing them each apart in my mind). I'd think: ""chicken, white-feathers-small, two feet"", while vigorously flitting to the other answers in kind. 

By the last problem, I began to look over the words and draw loose similarities before looking at their symbols.
